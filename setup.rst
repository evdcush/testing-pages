**The book building workflow:**

Building a Jupyter Book broadly consists of these steps:

#. **Create your book’s content.** You structure your book with a collection of folders, files, and configuration. See `Anatomy of a Jupyter Book. <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/create.html#anatomy-of-a-book>`_

#. **Build your book.** Using Jupyter Book’s command-line interface you can convert your pages into either an HTML or a PDF book. `See Build your book. <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html>`_

#. **Publish your book online.** Once your book is built, you can share it with others. Most common is to build HTML, and host it as a public website. See `Publish your book online. <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html>`_
